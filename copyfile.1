.El

.Sh EXIT STATUS
If
.Nm
is able to read the file specified, it exits with status code 0.

.Sh FILE STRUCTURE
.Nm
follows a simple structure for including files.
There are two ways a file is inluded.

The shebang symbol
.Pq Sy "#!"
is used as the inclusion operator and will always be included.
.Em NOTE:
If an inclusion operator is used before any text,
the first instance will be ignored as it is seen as a shebang.
If another file needs to be included immediately, preceding it with an empty variable
.Pq Sy "${}"
will allow that.

The environmental inclusion operator
.Pq Sy "#?"
will be included if the environment variable exists.
The environmental inclusion operator will include the file located at the value specified by the environment.
If the value is not specified in the environment, it will be ignored.

.Nm
also allows variable substitution.
Strings enclosed in
.Sy "${"
and
.Sy "}"
will be replaced with the value specified by the environment.
If the value is not specified in the environment, then it will be replaced with nothing.

.Em WARNING:
There are no checks for recursion.
